            <h4>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child brings to the fore the troubles of dealing with both famous and infamous legacies, of fragile human relationships, of having a shot at altering your life and deciding who to put first – yourself or others. It is very much a Potter book – it has all the plot twists and turns and characters and quotes that stay with you long after you have read the book. For anyone who tells you otherwise – don’t let them. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a beautiful rendition.</h4>

        <div class="book">
            <a><img src = "orientExpress.jpg" width=300 height=300></a>
            <h4>A wonderful whodunit from start to finish, Murder on the Orient Express has all the ingredients for a pacy and plot-driven read; atmospheric, with an isolated backdrop and an over-the-top cast of colourful characters. The pairing of the enigmatic Poirot on board the opulent Orient Express nods to the bygone era of the novel, and Christie writes in a wonderful fashion as she lingers over each of the characters in order to solve the mystery of who murdered the American tycoon onboard the luxury train.</h4>

            <a><img src = "charie.jpg" width=300 height=300></a>
            <h4> As with all Roald Dahl’s books, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a quaint and charming tale with a strong moral undertone. The book tells the story of Charlie Bucket, a young boy who lives in a cramped house with his parents and both his paternal and maternal grandparents. The family is a poor one; the four grandparents share a bed and they all live on a diet of boiled potatoes and cabbage. The town in which they live is famous for the landmark chocolate factory, maker of tantalising treats a-plenty, and the tale was inspired by Dahl’s experience of chocolate companies during his school days.</h4>
